This repo contain a Login & Registration page created React Typescript. At the current state, there is no backend developed yet to store information from users.

## Features

+ User Registration: Register one email and password.
+ User Login: Login with the last registered email and password.
+ Redirection after Login: Upon successful, user will be redirected to another page.

## Limitation

+ No Backend: The webpage is built without connecting to a database.
+ Single Account: Due to the lack of database, the system can only register and recognize the last registered email and password.
+ Single Page: To store the data from registration form, the login and registration are combined into one component/ page.

## Future Improvement

+ Implement backend support.
+ Breakdown each feature into single page.
+ Improve validation handling.
+ Improve user experience.
